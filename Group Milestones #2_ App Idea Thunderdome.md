**Group Milestones #2: App Idea Thunderdome**:

Choosing the right app idea is crucial as it sets the direction for your entire project. Here are some factors to consider:

- User Need: Is there a demand for the type of app you're considering? It's crucial to identify a real problem that the app can solve or a need it can fulfill.

- Market Research: Look at existing apps in the market. How would your app differentiate from them? Try to find a unique selling proposition (USP) that makes your app stand out.

- Feasibility: How complex is the app idea? Do you have the necessary skills and resources to implement it? It's important to choose an idea that is challenging but still within your team's capabilities.

- Time Frame: Considering the timeline for the project, is your app idea feasible within the given time frame? Remember you can keep working on this app after the class ends, but you need an end product for unit 10.

- Technical Constraints: Consider what kind of technical resources your app would require. This includes backend infrastructure, external APIs, database management, etc.

- Scalability: Does your app have the potential to grow? An app idea that has room for future features and updates could be more appealing.

**Event Suggestion API**: Using an API like Yelp or Eventbrite to get event recommendations. We can filter the results based on location, category, price range, and user preferences.

**User Authentication API**: User authentication API (e.g., OAuth) to manage user registration and login securely.

**Messaging API**: Implementing a messaging system for users to communicate within the app. We can use a service like Firebase Realtime Database or a chat API like SendBird.

**Payment API (Optional)**: If we want to allow users to book and pay for events within the app, integrate a payment gateway like Stripe.

**Geolocation API (Optional)**: If we want to provide location-based event suggestions, integrate a geolocation API like Google Maps.

# App #3: **FoodMood**

After continuously swiping and narrowing down the options, the app would use a process of elimination structure to eventually end up with one or a couple cuisines that the user would choose from.
